    Flock of birds<br>
Hovering above<br>
Just a flock of birds<br>
That's how you think of love<br>
<br>
And I always look up to the sky<br>
Pray before the dawn<br>
Cause they fly always<br>
Sometimes they arrive<br>
Sometimes they are gone<br>
Fly on<br>
<br>
Flock of birds<br>
Hovering above<br>
Into smoke I'm turned and rise, following them up<br>
Still I always look up to the sky<br>
Pray before the dawn<br>
Cause they fly away<br>
One minute they arrive<br>
Next you know they're gone<br>
Fly on<br>
<br>
Fly on, ride through<br>
Maybe one day I'll fly next to you<br>
Fly on, ride through<br>
Maybe one day I can fly with you<br>
Fly on<br>
